# php-login

This is a very a small application presenting an extremely-simple-and-almost-unrealistic login system written in PHP, which has been deliberately made vulnerable. 

## Starting up the application

To build and run the Docker container, you need to type:

	docker-compose build
  
	docker-compose up
  

Then the web application can be accessed on: http://localhost:8001/php-login/
